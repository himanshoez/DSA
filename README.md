# 📘 Data Structures & Algorithms in Java

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** learning journey implemented in **Java**.  
I am building this repository step by step, starting with **Recursion**, and gradually moving towards **Sorting, Searching**, and other core algorithmic concepts.

The focus is on:
- Understanding fundamental logic
- Writing clear, beginner-friendly Java code
- Developing strong problem-solving skills

---

## 🧠 Current Focus: Recursion

I am currently working on **Recursion Problems**, which form the foundation for many advanced DSA topics.

### Topics Covered So Far
- Printing numbers using recursion
- Counting and reverse counting
- Backtracking basics
- Summation using recursion
- Reversing an array using recursion

Each problem is implemented in a **separate Java file** for clarity and ease of understanding.
